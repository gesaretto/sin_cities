###Sin Cities
###Urban Landscapes and Infernal Vices in Literature, Art, and Film

In the _The Great Gatsby_, the region that connects Long Island to the Queensborough Bridge was memorably described as a "valley of ashes," an infernal territory populated by ghostly workers, ominous machines, and sinister buildings. That borough was Queens, a district of New York City, and Scott Fitzgerald, by comparing this urban landscape with a vision of hell, was alluding to a long artistic and literary tradition of analogous "sin cities," places where intense excitement and boundless possibility combined with the perception of danger, corruption, and misery. This course explores the manifold origins and developments of this tradition, from the doomed cities of Babel and Gomorrah, in the Old Testament, through the walls of Dite, the "city of fire" where Dante places the worst sinners in his _Inferno_, up to the fiendish criminals and super-villains who, like contemporary versions of the Seven Deadly Sins, haunt the streets of Metropolis and Gotham City. When is this association motivated by social and environmental realism, and when is it caused by prejudice against innovation and diversity? Over the course of these four weeks, we will analyze medieval and early modern conceptions of hell and vice, and we will investigate how these beliefs affected, and were affected by, the descriptions of cities and city life.
