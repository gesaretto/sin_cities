Gianmarco Saretto is pursuing a PhD in English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. For his dissertation project, _Literary Gluttons_, he is investigating how images of food, consumption, and gluttony were used to represent, critique, and meditate upon, late medieval literary practices. Moreover, Gianmarco is interested in the ways that literary forms can shape, and be shaped by, conceptions of bodies, economies, and environments. Before entering Columbia with a Fulbright scholarship, he earned a degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures from the Universit√† Cattolica of Milan, where he specialized in Spanish, English, French, and German. He is a bagel aficionado and overall New York enthusiast.
